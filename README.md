https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23158207-how-google-works

- If you want something done, give it to a busy person
- Knights and knaves and divas
- Base your product on strong technical insight, not on market research
	- Google Search - PageRank
	- AdWords - rank ads by how often people click on ads
	- Google News - group news by topic not source
- Focus on growth not revenue
- A fox knows everything but hedgehog knows one big thing. Good to great - all great companies are hedgehogs. Specializing is a riskier strategy.
- Hire good people, good people attract good people. Bad people attract bad people. Smart creatives are someone who is smart and creative.
- Pick the industry (early in the career) then the company (later in the career). 
- Negotiation rules: PIA (have patience, information, alternatives)
- Opra Winfree rule - it's not enough to make a good argument supported by data, you need to touch people's hearts.
- Spend 80% of your time on 80% of your revenue.
- Climb, Confess, Comply mode (when pilots are in danger they first fly higher, then talk to dispatcher, then follow his recommendation)
- 2 level game theory
- Jobs reality distortion field - Jobs asked engineer if he could shave off 10 seconds from the macintosh bootup time. 
    He said no. Then asked again but what if a person's life depended on it? He said well maybe. In a month he shaved of 20 seconds.
- Google X Venn Diagram to decide whether to pursue an idea:
	- Solves a big challenge
	- Solution that's radically different from anything else on the market
	- Feasible, achievable in not distance future
- 70/20/10 rule.
- Red flag law in the UK - after a car accident the government came up with a regulation that instructed to have 
    a person with a red flag coming in front of every car, and 2 mile/h in the city, 4 miles/h outside.

## The Power of Habit

- Tingling in the mouth after brushing teeth is created by marketers to give people an illusion that the tooth paste
    works. The chemicals in the tooth paste that cause tingling don't have any purpose other than to create this illusion.
- [Febreze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Febreze) eliminates odor. People didn't want to buy it at first.
    Proctor & Gamble marketers added a scent and created an association with freshness via advertisement which increased
    sales by multiple times.

## Zero to One

https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296

1. There is vertical and horizontal progress. 
    - **Vertical** progress is a radical improvement, going from zero to one, and is achievable using technology.
    - **Horizontal** progress is expanding on the radical improvement, e.g. via globalisation. 
    - USA makes vertical progress, China horizontal.
2. The dot com boom and burst people created **dogmas**:
    - Make incremental advances, small steps,
    - Be lean, don't plan far ahead,
    - Improve on the competition, don't try to create new market prematurely,
    - Focus on product, not advertising
  Depending on the circumstances, the company and the market conditions the opposite might be true.
3. Monopolies try to conceal they are monopolies, to avoid anti-trust laws. E.g. Google claims it has 3% in global
    advertising business. They support the claim by using union of factors, e.g. Google unions digital advertisement
    markets and non-digital. 
  Non-monopolies try to convince investors they own entire market, e.g. a British food restaurant in Bay Area telling
   they own entire market. They support the claim by using intersection of factors e.g. a British food restaurant, 
   in a specific area, themed with rock-n-roll style.
4. All successful companies are unique, they become monopolies for solving unique problems. All failed companies 
    are same, they fail to escape the competition.
5. Competition is not always good for companies, and consumers. A monopoly has spare resources to invest in
    long-term visionary projects. Companies in the environment of strong competition have little spare resources. 
    PayPal had to merge with x.com to survive the financial crisis.
6. Moats:
  - Proprietary technology
  - Network effects
  - Economies of scale
  - Brand
7. Biotech companies struggle to succeed comparing to tech companies, because the human body is a lot more complex that
    computer systems built by humans.
8. Power Law:
    - Only a few companies in investment portfolio justify all other failed investments. Invest only in companies that
    have a potential to justify all other investments. 
    - Only a few decisions are most important
    - Distribution channels follow the Power Law.
9. Secrets - ask yourself a question, what thing do you know that other struggle to understand. This secret gives you
    an edge in achieving success. 
    - Kazinskiy: goals can be easy to achieve, hard to achieve and impossible to achieve. All problems that are hard
    to achieve have already been solved, easy goals don't bring satisfaction - the only way to happiness is to destroy
    the civilization and start over.
10. Foundations are important for startups. 
    - CEO should pay little to himself and be mostly incentivized by his stake in the company.
    - Founders should have worked before and know each other well.
11. PayPal mafia:
    - Spend time with people you like - you spend most time with colleagues.
    - Company should be a cult. Opposite are consulting firms like Accenture where employees has no connections to it.
12. Sales matter.
13. Machines will complement people not replace them. 
14. Green Tech:
    - Engineering - your solution must be orders of magnitude better. 
    - Timing - is it the right time now?
    - Monopoly - you better have a big share in a small market.
    - Team - you must have the right team.
    - Distribution - you must have distribution channels.
    - Durability - you should have a defendable position for 10-20 years into the future.
    - Secret - you must have a secret no one knows.
