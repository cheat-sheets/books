**Detailed notes**:

1. Work rules for becoming a **founder**

- 20/70/10 performance ranking. 20% top performance, 70% - normal performance, 10% - fired
- Jack Welch - 6 sigma https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Sigma
- Romania like North Korea
- Freedom environment attracts top talent
- Managers can't make decisions unilaterally - who to hire, fire, if quality is enough, who to promote
- Managers serve the team - clearing roadblocks and inspiring the team
- Research - no operations improvements increase productivity
- Only giving employees freedom improved performance
- Make people owners

2. Work Rules for building a great **culture**

- Larry and Sergei created most culture rules
- Early Google employees took initiatives e.g. opened an office in New York
- Culture eats strategy for breakfast
- 3 defining factors of culture: mission, transparency, voice
- Having workers meet with people they are helping can increase productivity 500%, it creates a sense of purpose. Find deeper meaning in their work
- Transparency. Default to open. Open source. Newly hired engineer can view all code. Hangouts On Air Q&A
- Late binding, sometimes there is benefit in delaying decisions - chrome and android, it's better to keep both as each one has its streamers, rather than choosing only one of them
- Make all calls available to everyone - Ray Dalio
- Privacy - user data is critical
- Openness and transparency if you put people first
- Voice - they cover tax for gays. Giving people voice improves decision making quality
- Google does't have servers in China because they can't sensor results, it's Google's value
- Treat your work as calling with a mission

3. **Hiring**

- All hires should be above average. Hiring is the single most important activity in the org
- It's been tested in baseball. Highest paying team wins often but not all the time. Moneyball - data analytics.
- Acquihiring - destroying companies, bringing people to your company. A way to hire great people who otherwise wouldn't join you. Yahoo paid 30M for Summly https://www.wired.com/2013/03/yahoo-summly/
- Many companies have the following strategy - hire average and train them to champions
- They all have average hires since they all use same processes. Most people are not good interviewers.
- Most interviewers are biased towards people like them.
- Bush met Putin, I looked him on the eye and saw his soul
- Einstein - change context of work to become great
- 90th percentile performers and they start doing work right away.
- Most companies don't invest enough on hiring. Repurpose training to hiring
- Until 2010 Google didn't pay higher. People had to take cuts when joining Google
- 2 big changes:
    - Hire more slowly. Only 10% will be best performers. A top notch engineer is worth 300 times more than an average engineer. Ex. Jeff Dean. Search index in memory
    - Only hire people who are better than you in some meaningful way
- Managers give up power of hiring, it reduces bias.
- Humility and conscientiousness are the top characteristic of a good hire

4. Finding **exceptional candidates**

- Self-replicating hiring machine
- 3M people apply to Google per year
- Founders started with hiring the smartest people
- Realized that the should be hiring by commitee
- Two teams for hiring: product and engineering, marketing and sales.
- Back door references. If you worked or studied at the same place. 50 pages of profile after interviews.
- Google looks for smart generalists rather than experts.
- Among 100 first employees became CEOs, philanthropists, etc.
- Best source of candidates were referrals
- Increasing referral bonus didn't increase referrals
- Referral are made for intrinsic reasons
- Best people don't apply for jobs
- Knowable universe exercise - LinkedIn
- Job boards generate a lot of candidates but few hires. Bad people list their resumes on job boards
- 1 get the best referrals by being specific
- 2 get recruiting everyone's job
- 3 don't be afraid to experiment to attract top talent

5. Work rules for **selecting new employees**

- Study shows the first 10 seconds predict the outcome of the interview
    - Unstructured interviews can explain 14% of job performance. R of 0.14
    - Reference checks - 7%
    - Number of years of work experience - 3%
    - Work sample test - 29% (representative work sample is hard to create)
    - Test of general cognitive ability - 26%
    - Structured interviews 26% behavioral, situational questions
    - Test of conscientiousness - 10%
- Q droid - internal service at Google for finding interview questions for a position
- Vox populi - feedback from candidates
- 4 attributes are tested during the interview process
    - General cognitive ability
    - Leadership, emergent leadership. Google is against leaders who champion themselves
    - Googleness - fun, ok with ambiguity, courage
    - Role related knowledge
- Later Google moved to balance of generalists and experts
- Each interviewer reports
    - Attribute being assessed
    - Question and answer
    - Interviewers assessment
- Constantly check that interview works
- Same as other products improve, so does the hiring machine
- Rule of 4 interviews
- Median time to hire 37 days
- Interviewers are evaluated too. They can see their assessment and whether candidate was hired
- Never compromise on quality
- Only recruiters evaluate resumes
- After screening, phone interviews
    - 3 subordinate interview
    - 4 cross-functional interview, e.g. legal to interview sales
    - 5 feedback is evaluated by committee
    - 6 rely on disinterested interviewers
- Larry personally reviews applications
- 4 to 10 hours is spent on hiring for each employee
- Top executives spent a full day on it
- Time spent is reduced over time

6. Work rules for **mass empowerment**

- AB testing, 1% tests
- Same for people. Upward management feedback
- Creativity needs freedom, 20% of week focus on projects they like
- The idea of 20% rather than reality, not policy
- Paul Buchheit worked on Gmail for 2.5 years. Google thought it's too far from search
- Meritocratic, bonus is based on median salary not personal
- Googlegeist - annual survey, 100 questions. Confidentially or anonymously - no personally identified
- 5 questions that correlate with people quitting
- Ethos of simplification, improve recognition of people simplifying code. Talks, education
- Partnered with people operations to make sure it's accounted for in performance reviews
- Citizenship awards for people who simplify
- Bureaucracy busters. Don't require paper receipts

7. Work rules for **performance management**

- Improve performance by focusing on personal growth instead of ratings and rewards
- Concerns - takes too much time, not transparent, not fair
- OKRs are public to the company
- Measuring performance
- 41 point scale. Average 3.3 and 3.4
- Tried with different parameters, tried different number of grades: 3 to 50 grades. Yearly, quarterly, real time
- (1) Consensus impossible, (2) Desire for seriousness, (3) Experimentation important
- Having more categories - with 15 categories, employees decided they had fewer superb performers. with 5 categories had 5% superb performers
- Calibration - removes sources of individual bias. Recency bias, hand out common errors to reduce bias
- Ratings are tools for fairness, pay more for more work
- Avoid defensiveness, promote learning
- Intrinsic motivation drives performance, external motivation removed internal motivation. Study about assembling puzzle
- With ratings there is incentive to gamble the system
- Performance evaluation is separate from development evaluation
- Every time you open your mouth you add value
- Promotions are reviewed by committees, fairness. Googlers nominate themselves
- Colleges and partnerships spend a lot of time on performance reviews
- Set goals correctly public ambitious
- Gather peer feedback
- For evaluation adapt calibration, meetings to review profiles
- Split reward conversations from development conversations, combining them kills learning

8. Work rules for managing your **2 tails**: the best opportunities lie in best and worst employees

- Height - gaussian, bell curve, applied in cases where it doesn't fit
- Power law - letter L
- Most companies treat employees as bell curve distribution. But the tails aren't symmetrical, bad employees
  get fired, the worst don't even make it in the door. Human performance follows power law distribution
- Most companies undervalue and underpay their best people
- People in the bottom tail present biggest opportunity. In GM bottom 10% get fired, you either move up or move out
- Google tracks 5% of bottom performance. They let them know that they are in the bottom 5%
- Typically lack of skill, or will, not motivated. Google de-emphasize role related hiring. They believe people will figure out their place
- Google only intervent to bottom 5% people
- Put best people under microscope
- Project oxygen, what if everyone had an amazing manager. Manager quality didn't have an effect on performance
- Engineers believe that managers don't matter. In 2011 Larry and Sergei eliminated managers. Within 6 weeks were reinstated
- Manager has to be at least as technically capable as their team. No-op manager otherwise
- Engineers moved from worst to best managers and visa versa, it showed engineers performance improved
- Checklist in airplane saved lives
- Semi annual upper feedback
- Help those in need
- Put your best people under microscope
- Use surveys and checklists to surface the truth and nudge people to tell the truth
- Have people who are best train everyone else

9. Work rules for building a learning institution

- It's better to deliver less content but make sure it sticks
- Teaching scales geometrically, individual linearly
- It's better to learn from people who work today
- Googler mindfulness, improves decision making
- G to g knowledge sharing between googlers
- Presenting with charisma
- I2p intro to programming to non engineers
- Rebecca Cotton career guru
- Leadership sales gurus
- Only invest in courses that change behavior
- Stories are key to teaching
- Behavior, Results
- Experiment to measure the results, try on one group and compare to another
- 3 rules:
    1. Engage in deliberate practice, break lessons down to small digestible pieces and do them repeatedly, improve via feedback
    2. Have your best people teach
    3. Invest only course that can change people behaviour, and you can prove it

10. Work rules for paying unfairly

## High Output Management

https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove/dp/0679762884

https://medium.com/@iantien/top-takeaways-from-andy-grove-s-high-output-management-2e0ecfb1ea63

- Borrowing from production, high output is the defining quality of good management
- A manager's output equals the output of his organization plus the output of neighboring organizations 
    that he influences
- Should you be a hands on or hands off manager? It depends on whether your subordinate can deliver the desired output  
- Motivation and training are the two main manager's tasks
                     
**PART 1: On Organizational Output**

- **Chapter 1**: The Basics of Production
    - Whether you're compiling code, hiring staff, convicting a criminal, or making breakfast, everything can be 
      modeled as a repeatable production process.
    - Understanding the elements of production — inputs, outputs, timing, limiting steps, quality controls, variability — 
      lets us create and improve the "machinery" needed to fulfill our organizational goals. We all aim to achieve 
      the same thing: **high quality results in less time with least waste**.
- **Chapter 2**: Managing the Breakfast Factory
    - Focus on vital, measurable **indicators** of output
    - Train your team to select a **small number** of objective, quantifiable measures of output
    - **Avoid** measures of activity, **subjective** measures and **unquantifiable** measures
    - Your job is to identify, closely monitor and effectively manage the **vital few** indicators of performance over the **compelling many**

**PART 2: On Leading Teams**

- **Chapter 3**: **MANAGERIAL LEVERAGE**
    - Managers "leverage" their time by spending small amounts to have large impact through three activities: 
        1) information gathering
        2) decision making
        3) "nudging" others
    - Doing it **right** means positive high leverage actions: 
        1) delegation with supervision
        2) training 
        3) influencing processes with unique skills or knowledge 
    - Doing it **wrong** means negative high leverage actions: 
        1) delaying decisions 
        2) meddling, 
        3) abdication 
        4) unnecessary interruption
    - **Managerial meddling** - doing work for subordinate which makes him assume he will be helper later
    - The normal number of subordinates for a manager who only manages people is 6 to 8. 
      It takes a manager half a day per subordinate
- **Chapter 4**: **MEETINGS**
    - Process-oriented meetings:
        - **One on one**  are used to exchange information, discuss thorny issues, uncover problems and review important but not urgent items
        - **Staff meeting** - a meeting where a supervisor and all subordinates are present, used for free discussion, 
          sharing of different points of view, and decision making
        - **Operations review** - meeting where people who otherwise don't interact with each other can meet. Between peers
    - **Mission-oriented meetings**, created ad-hoc to reach a decision
    - Spending more than 25% of time in mission-oriented meetings is a sign of mal-organization
- **Chapter 5**: **DECISIONS**
    - You need to make sure everyone supports a decision, but not necessarily agrees
    - Decisions should be made at the lowest competent level  because they are the ones who will implement it
    - Peer group syndrome - people are afraid to speak up without a manager present 
    - If unending loop of discussions arises then ask these 6 questions:
        - What decision is needed? 
        - By when? 
        - Who should be consulted? 
        - Who decides? 
        - Who ratifies or vetoes? 
        - Who needs to be informed?
- **Chapter 6**: **PLANNING**
    - Move towards long term plans using short-term Objectives (sub-goals) and corresponding Key Results
    - Cascade "OKRs" across organizations, so one manager's key results might make up the objectives of their direct reports, and so on
    - OKRs provide clarity and alignment, but they can't be run on auto-pilot. 
      It takes judgment and common sense to guide day-to-day priorities based on OKR hierarchies.

**PART 3: On Leading Enterprises**

- **Chapter 7**: **As organizations grow speed decreases while leverage increases**
    - Businesses become more complex as they grow. Duplication and redundancy increase
    - Decisions are constantly being made on whether to 
      - **centralize functions for consistency** and greater leverage, or 
      - **decentralize for greater speed**
- **Chapter 8**: **HYBRID ORGANIZATIONS**
    - All large organizations with a common purpose end up in hybrid organization (exception: conglomerates)
    - **Function-oriented** teams (e.g. "Recruiting", "Finance", "Human Resources") increase **leverage**, 
    - **Objective-oriented** (e.g. "Component Business Group", "Systems Business Group") teams increase **speed**
    - Function-oriented teams are akin to cross-cutting concerns in software engineering, e.g. logging, monitoring, security
    - Objective-oriented teams are akin to other logical components of a software system
- **Chapter 9**: **DUAL REPORTING**
    - Invented at NASA as "matrix management" individuals in dual reporting structures have managers in both 
      objective-oriented and function-oriented teams (e.g. A financial controller reports to both the Division Manager and the Director of Finance)
    - While this solution creates complexity, the cost of complexity is outweighed by the benefits of 
      operating in both functional and mission-oriented teams
- **Chapter 10**: **MODES OF CONTROL**
    - Our behavior is control by 3 invisible but pervasive means:
        - Free market forces
        - Contractual obligations
        - Culture
    - Mode of control is selected based on 
        - Motivation of employee (**self-interested vs group interested**) and 
        - Environment (charaterized by **CUA: Complexity, Uncertainty, Ambiguity**)
    - Quadrant of modes of control:
        - If self-interest is high, and CUA factors are low - market conditions mode 
        - If group motivation is high, and CUA factors are low - contractual mode
        - If group motivation is high, and CUA factors are high - culture
        - If self-interest is high, and CUA factors are high - no mode of control will work
    - It's a manager's responsibility to align team members to group interests


**PART 4: On Leading People**

- **Chapter 11**: **MOTIVATE PEOPLE**
    - If subordinate doesn't do their job it's either because they can't do it or they don't want to do it
    - The two most important tasks of a manager: **training** and **motivating** - lead people to self-actualuzation
    - Needs determine motivation
        - Maslow pyramid of needs, self-actualization is at the top of the pyramid, most other needs are self-limiting
        - Self-actualization can be either competence driven or achievement driven. Achievement driven is better cause
            it created results
- **Chapter 12**: **TASK-RELEVANT MATURITY**
    - Depending on the task-relevant maturity of an employee manager's involment should be either high with 
      task-oriented management style, or low focused only on setting and monitoring high-level objectives.
    - Analogy with a child learning to ride a bicycle - first he rides a three-wheeler, 
      then you advise him to switch to a two-wheeler, support him and teach the rules. Then he leaves home and goes to college.
- **Chapter 13**: **PERFORMANCE REVIEWS**
    - Having an argument in English means fighting. The proper word when fighting is not implied is a debate or discussion
    - Delivering performance review: Level, Listen and Leave yourself out
    - Types of performance reviews:
        - On the one hand, on the other hand
        - The blast
    - 5 stages of problem identified in performance review:
        - Ignoring
        - Denying 
        - Accepting
        - Assuming responsibility
        - Finding a solution
    - Give written review before meeting face to face so subordinate has time to prepare
- **Chapter 14: Two difficult tasks**
    - **Interviewing**
        - If interviewee goes off track say, I'm sorry I'd like to change the subject to xyz, don't waste the time
        - 4 categories of questions:
            - Understanding their technical knowledge
            - How he used his knowledge and skills
            - Reasons for discrepancies between his knowledge skills and performance
            - His values
    - **Try to talk a valued employee out of quitting**
        - When someone is dedicated and loyal and feels their work is unappreciated it is the failure of the manager when they decide to leave
- **Chapter 15: COMPENSATION**
    - Performance based vs experience based compensation
    - Recycle high achievers who are over-promoted
    - The art of constructive confrontation - problem solving approach
- **Chapter 16: TRAINING**
    - Training is the highest leverage activity a manager can do to increase the output of an organization
    - If a manager spends 12 hours preparing training for 10 team members that increases their output by 1% on average, 
      the result is 200 hours of increased output from the 10 employees (each works about 2000 hours a year)
    - Don't leave training to outsiders, do it yourself

## The Selfish Gene

https://www.amazon.com/Selfish-Gene-Popular-Science/dp/0192860925
    
- **Chapter 1: Why Are People?**
    - The use of contraceptives proves that we are capable of behaving against our primal instincts,
      create fake meaning in life.
    - **Self-deception** evolved to protect the lies, not to expose them to others.
    - Examples of **altruistic behavior**: 
        - Bees stinging enemies and losing a part of their body then dying
        - Monkeys screaming when seeing a predator, which notifies other monkeys
    - **Speciesism** is normal while **racism** is not. Killing chimpanzees is ok.
    - Group selection doesn't make sense, lions shouldn't kill antilopes because they both members of group mammals.
      Dawkins claims that the **theory of group selection is wrong**. Instead, **evolution operates on genes**.
- **Chapter 2: The Replicators**  
    - From a soup of atoms molecules can randomly assemble. Even complex molecules like aminoacids.
      At some point replicator molecules may assemble.
      There is positive and negative replication. DNA is an example of negative replication.
    - Hebrew word for young woman (alma) was mistranslated into virgin in Greek: **behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son**. 
      Maiden in English can mean a young woman or virgin.
    - Evolution favors high fidelity replication i.e. with low number of errors. 
      A paradox here is that evolution happens despite all the efforts of replicators to prevent it happening.
- **Chapter 3: Immortal Coils**      
    - **Humans are survival machines for genes**. I.e. first there was just protective protein coat around replicators - a cell.
      Then it grew into primitive multi-celular organisms, etc. until complex organisms like primates. 
    - **Chromosomes are volumes in a book**, genes are pages in a book. 
      Genes interact with each other, you can't find a gene for long legs or altruism.
    - **23 pairs of chromosomes**, one pair from the father another from the mother. 
      Gene for eye color can be different in each side of chromosome, only one will be used the other is recessive 
      and will be passed to future generations. Only if both genes inhereted from mother and father are for blue eyes, the
      person will have blue eyes.
    - Gene pool: all genes in the population. Sex mixes chromosomes, sex cells have only 23 chromosomes.
    - Sperm and eggs have a mix of paternal and maternal genes, each sperm or egg has a different mix. 
      Sperm and eggs are created during meiotic division.
    - During meiotic division paternal and maternal genes crossover. Crossover may occur in the middle of a gene. 
      The shorter a gene the more likely it's to be passed to next generation as it's less likely to be split due to crossover.
    - **Cistron** - a group of genes. Genes generally fit between the cistron and chromosome in scale.
    - Properties of a successful unit of natural selection - **longevity**, **fecundity**, **copying fidelity**.
    - **Genes are analogous to members of a boat in a rowing competition**. 
      You need 8 good members to win, they cooperate, but compete with other people for a particular role in the boat. 
      Wind is external environment.
    - Lethal genes cause the survival machine to die at some point in life. 
      Semi-lethal genes make it more likely to die from some cause. 
      E.g. a gene that causes old body to develop cancer would be passed on to next generations.
    - Death doesn't contradict natural selection. **We could prohibit making children until the age of 40** and it would 
      increase the average life span over time. 
      Doing this could increase the life to several hundred years.
- **Chapter 4: The Gene Machine**      
    - Some flies don't have crossing over, in this case the whole chromosome is a gene.
    - Limbic system is parallel. Cortex is serial. 
      Like Macintosh user interface simulates folders and files in the UI. 
      Cortex allows us to run simulations which creates an illusion of consciousness.
    - Stable sex ratio is 50/50, it can be calculated using game theory methods.
    - Hawk vs dove, for example 5/12 doves and 7/12 hawks.
    - ESS - Evolutionary Stable Strategy.
- **Chapter 5: Aggression: Stability and the Selfish Machine**  
    - There is territorial defense, e.g. in tigers. 
      The strategy is: if you are an intruder you escape if you are the owner you attack. 
      This strategy may develop when there are no other differentiators e.g. size. 
      People often use this strategy e.g. when occupying parking lots.
    - Stable gene set, gene set in the population form an evolutionary stable set.
    - Recessive gene kills its owner if there are two copies of it. That's why incest is taboo.
    - Birds discriminate eggs so they don't take care of other eggs by accident. 
      Game theory shows that if they didn't do it cheaters would lay eggs and have honest birds brood over them.
- **Chapter 6: Genesmanship**  
    - Kinship (relatedness) of twins is 1. 
      Kinship to parents, siblings, and children is 0.5. 
      Kinship to grandparents, grandchildren, cousins, nephews, nieces is 0.25.
    - Lions on average have 0.22 kinship for males and 0.15 kinship for females. 
      The altruistic gene then encodes behavior assuming this number, any deviation from it is penalized by natural selection.
    - In terms of kinship parent-child relationship is same as brother-sister relationship (0.5 kinship). 
      The certainty is higher for the parent-child relationship though, so care is manifested more.
    - If your mother is monogamous she is as good a genetic bet as you yourself (she can produce siblings for you == you producing children) some insects store sperm after the first mating, e.g. ants.
    - Altruism from uncles of mother side is higher than altruism from uncles of father side since there is less 
      confidence the children are from the father (she might have cheated). 
      Mother's brother effect - Maternal brother should be more altruistic than apparent father.
    - [Fraternal birth order effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraternal_birth_order_and_male_sexual_orientation) -
      the more older brothers a male has from the same mother, the greater the probability he will have a homosexual orientation.
- **Chapter 7: Family Planning**
    - Bearing and caring strategy. There can be no only caring strategy as it's not stable.
    - Caring for children affects the optimal number of children cause caring requires resources. 
      Different species of birds lay different number of eggs.
    - PI - parental investment is any parental expenditure that benefits offspring.
    - Menopause is genetically explained, older woman has lower chances of their children surviving. 
      At around 40 years old chances are 2 times lower than those of their grandchildren.
- **Chapter 8: Battle of the Generations**  
    - Parents try to maximize the chances of their offspring survival, pick the best number of children and 
          allocate food according to needs. 
      Children scream to indicate they are hungry. Some children scream more to cheat and get more food at a cost of siblings. 
      But that strategy is not winning cause this gene will be in their children and it will have reduced the capacity to replicate.
    - The stable ratio of males to females is 50/50 for organisms. 
      A gene spends 50% of his life in a male body and 50 in female. 
      Some genes e.g. penis length are only expressed in one sex.
    - It's more likely that a male abandons its offspring than a female cause for a female it's a much larger investment of resources.
    - [Bruce effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_effect) - female rodents will lose the pregnancy if exposed to
          another male within 24 hours.
    - At a certain level of development of a child it's best strategy for one of parents to leave. 
      The one who leaves first is in advantages position. 
      It only works if a child is at the level that just one parent is enough to bring him up.
- **Chapter 9: Battle of the Sexes**  
    - **Domestic bliss strategy** - she plays hard to get, he proves his fidelity and perseverance.
      **He-man strategy** - the female goes for the best genes, accepting that she will get no help from the father (elephant seals, female copulates with the best male by visible clues. Small proportion of males copulates with all females)
    - Coy fast strategies - for female
      Faithful filandro strategies for male
    - There will be a stable equilibrium in which there is a certain proportion of strategies.
    - The strategy of a female of asking him to do initial investment e.g. build a nest or climb a mountain or kill a dragon 
      is stable as it ensures he will not desert after copulating. 
      He'd have to kill another dragon if he wanted to copulate with another female.
    - Paternal care is common in water but rare on land, visa versa for maternal care. 
      Female fish can spew her eggs and leave, male can't do this as male sperm would diffuse unlike female eggs. 
      Then after male spews sperm on eggs he has to care of it as the female is already gone. 
      There is a paper that shows the hypothesis is wrong.
    - Sexual selection: paradise birds select males with long tails. 
      In the beginning it was an indicator of success, further it was increased because females used 
      a simple rule of choosing male with long tale.
    - Chimpanzee have bones in their penis called baculum.
      Erection failure is an early warning of diabetes or psychological diseases. 
      It's a warning sign for the female to not copulate. 
      Similar to how long tails of paradise birds is a sign of good health (no diarrhea), erection is a sign of good health. 
      That's why humans lost bone in penises since it helps females to pick better males.
      **Handicap principle** - males develop a handicap such as a long tail which is sexually selected.
    - Hoarding of animals explained by them trying to surround themselves with other animals., so they don't get eaten.
    - Gazelles jump high to show they are healthy and not an easy prey.
    - Beehives are warm inside although bees are not warm blooded, they behave like an organism. 
      Most individuals are sterile like in bodies only testes eggs and ovaries are not sterile
    - Hairless rodents behave like social insects. 
      Grasshoppers is a special cast of social locusts that go out and eat everything.
    - **Haplodiploidy** is a sex-determination system in which males develop from unfertilized eggs and are haploid, 
      and females develop from fertilized eggs and are diploid.
    - Some ants farm fungi on leaves. Farming in other sense means that worker bees farm their genes on the queen bee.
- **Chapter 10: You Scratch My Back, I'll Ride on Yours**  
    - Bees cheats suckers grudgers. 
      Grudgers are tit for tat, remove ticks from head of others. 
      Grudgers will win but some cheats will be left.
      Suckers are not beneficial to grudges because they cause the prosperity of cheats.
- **Chapter 11: Memes: The New Replicators**  
    - **Meme** is a living structure, it occupies nerve cells in brains of humans and spreaders across them.
      The God meme survived not because of the advantage to Hunans but advantage to the meme.
      It's possible that not religion causes survival but some other factor causes religion and survival e.g. desire to have idols.
    - Don't seek immortality in gene reproduction rather in meme reproduction.
- **Chapter 12: Nice Guys Finish First**  
    - Axelrod's tit-for-tat, 16 strategies competing with each other pairwise.
      Naive prober does better than tit-for-tat.
      Remorseful prober does even better.
      In the third round he ran multiple generations to see which one will outnumber others. 
      Tit-for-tat is not an ESS, it can be evaded by other nice strategies e.g. always cooperate.
      If a population is already dominated by defectors it is an ESS, can't be evaded by other strategies.
      Tit-for-tat is not envious, it doesn't care about other people rewards, only about maximizing their reward from nature.
      The British and Germans developed tit-for-tat strategy when on front line in a war with each other. You don't shoot me I won't shoot you, long term game, live and let lived.
- **Chapter 13: The Long Reach of the Gene**  
    - Bacteria and animals also play strategy games. Some bacteria can cause sepsis when individual is wounded and in normal circumstances it helps.
    - Vampire bats share blood when the bro is in need, they also play tit-for-tat.
    - Segregation distorters have unfair advantage comparing to aliel genes, for example T-genes in mice. 
      If there are 2 of T-genes the mouse dies.
    - Rabies virus makes the host behave in a way that makes spreading the virus easy. 
      Animal is roaming around like crazy ignoring dangers, biting others, salivating.
      Does hiv increase libido?
      Genes are replicators, bodies are vehicles.
    - A bee hive behaves like a single organism because the genes originate from the queen. 
      The condition is that genes must have a single genetic route, for it to be considered a vehicle. 
      That's why a pack of wolves is not an organism.
    - 3 questions:
        - Why do genes aggregate into cells - cooperation gives benefits eg multi step chemical reactions are possible.
        - Why do cells aggregate into organisms - bigger size and separation of functions helps.
        - Why do organism have a bottlenecked lifecycle. Start as single cell and a result is single cell.


## How Google Works

https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23158207-how-google-works

Google Search doesn't have any network effect. Google's culture does. Google is hiring the best of the best engineers
which attracts more best engineers. Every new engineer increases the value of the company non-linearly and increases
the chance more best engineers will want to join.

- If you want something done, give it to a busy person
- Knights and knaves and divas
- Base your product on strong technical insight, not on market research
    - Google Search - PageRank
    - AdWords - rank ads by how often people click on ads
    - Google News - group news by topic not source
- Focus on growth not revenue
- A fox knows everything but hedgehog knows one big thing. Good to great - all great companies are hedgehogs. Specializing is a riskier strategy.
- Hire good people, good people attract good people. Bad people attract bad people. Smart creatives are someone who is smart and creative.
- Pick the industry (early in the career) then the company (later in the career). 
- Negotiation rules: PIA (have patience, information, alternatives)
- Opra Winfree rule - it's not enough to make a good argument supported by data, you need to touch people's hearts.
- Spend 80% of your time on 80% of your revenue.
- Climb, Confess, Comply mode (when pilots are in danger they first fly higher, then talk to dispatcher, then follow his recommendation)
- 2 level game theory
- Jobs reality distortion field - Jobs asked engineer if he could shave off 10 seconds from the macintosh bootup time. 
    He said no. Then asked again but what if a person's life depended on it? He said well maybe. In a month he shaved of 20 seconds.
- Google X Venn Diagram to decide whether to pursue an idea:
    - Solves a big challenge
    - Solution that's radically different from anything else on the market
    - Feasible, achievable in not distance future
- 70/20/10 rule.
- Red flag law in the UK - after a car accident the government came up with a regulation that instructed to have 
    a person with a red flag coming in front of every car, and 2 mile/h in the city, 4 miles/h outside.

## The Power of Habit

https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X

- Tingling in the mouth after brushing teeth is created by marketers to give people an illusion that the tooth paste
    works. The chemicals in the tooth paste that cause tingling don't have any purpose other than to create this illusion.
- [Febreze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Febreze) eliminates odor. People didn't want to buy it at first.
    Proctor & Gamble marketers added a scent and created an association with freshness via advertisement which increased
    sales by multiple times.

## Zero to One

https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296

1. There is vertical and horizontal progress. 
    - **Vertical** progress is a radical improvement, going from zero to one, and is achievable using technology.
    - **Horizontal** progress is expanding on the radical improvement, e.g. via globalisation. 
    - USA makes vertical progress, China horizontal.
2. The dot com boom and burst people created **dogmas**:
    - Make incremental advances, small steps,
    - Be lean, don't plan far ahead,
    - Improve on the competition, don't try to create new market prematurely,
    - Focus on product, not advertising
  Depending on the circumstances, the company and the market conditions the opposite might be true.
3. Monopolies try to conceal they are monopolies, to avoid anti-trust laws. E.g. Google claims it has 3% in global
    advertising business. They support the claim by using union of factors, e.g. Google unions digital advertisement
    markets and non-digital. 
  Non-monopolies try to convince investors they own entire market, e.g. a British food restaurant in Bay Area telling
   they own entire market. They support the claim by using intersection of factors e.g. a British food restaurant, 
   in a specific area, themed with rock-n-roll style.
4. All successful companies are unique, they become monopolies for solving unique problems. All failed companies 
    are same, they fail to escape the competition.
5. Competition is not always good for companies, and consumers. A monopoly has spare resources to invest in
    long-term visionary projects. Companies in the environment of strong competition have little spare resources. 
    PayPal had to merge with x.com to survive the financial crisis.
6. Moats:
  - Proprietary technology
  - Network effects
  - Economies of scale
  - Brand
7. Biotech companies struggle to succeed comparing to tech companies, because the human body is a lot more complex that
    computer systems built by humans.
8. Power Law:
    - Only a few companies in investment portfolio justify all other failed investments. Invest only in companies that
    have a potential to justify all other investments. 
    - Only a few decisions are most important
    - Distribution channels follow the Power Law.
9. Secrets - ask yourself a question, what thing do you know that other struggle to understand. This secret gives you
    an edge in achieving success. 
    - Kazinskiy: goals can be easy to achieve, hard to achieve and impossible to achieve. All problems that are hard
    to achieve have already been solved, easy goals don't bring satisfaction - the only way to happiness is to destroy
    the civilization and start over.
10. Foundations are important for startups. 
    - CEO should pay little to himself and be mostly incentivized by his stake in the company.
    - Founders should have worked before and know each other well.
11. PayPal mafia:
    - Spend time with people you like - you spend most time with colleagues.
    - Company should be a cult. Opposite are consulting firms like Accenture where employees has no connections to it.
12. Sales matter.
13. Machines will complement people not replace them. 
14. Green Tech:
    - Engineering - your solution must be orders of magnitude better. 
    - Timing - is it the right time now?
    - Monopoly - you better have a big share in a small market.
    - Team - you must have the right team.
    - Distribution - you must have distribution channels.
    - Durability - you should have a defendable position for 10-20 years into the future.
    - Secret - you must have a secret no one knows. 

## Stress-Free Living

https://www.amazon.com/Mayo-Clinic-Guide-Stress-Free-Living/dp/B01J2BMZD2

1. Mind has 2 states: **focused** and **default**. Focused mode is when the mind is externally directed, 
    default mode is when the mind is internally directed. 
    - [A Wandering Mind is an Unhappy Mind](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/330/6006/932.full)
    - Ruminations are thoughts about past events, worries are thoughts about future events.
    - Mind can only keep around 7 items of information at a time. It has a queue of tasks or things to think about. 
      When the queue is too long it causes "thrashing" or stress.
2. Human mind selectively attends to threat, pleasure and novelty. 
    - Threat is the predominant focus. 
    - The majority of modern threats are our inter-emotional battles.
    - Our minds are innately restless and irrational.
    - The new mantra of survival is "survival of the kindest". Some research shows that people look for kindness in
      their partners.
3. Be happy with what you have, don't compare yourself with others, compare yourself with previous version of you.
    What you have now many people can't even dream about. 
    - A story of how **Darwin** lost his beetles while he was collecting samples of insects. He had 2 beetles - one in 
      each hand. He saw another beetle not far from him and wanted to pick him. After putting one of the beetles in
      his mouth, the beetle stung his tongue, Darwin shoked had to throw away both beetles and lost the 3rd too. 
      The moral is be content with what you have.
    - **Acceptance** - don't cling to desired outcomes, accept everything. Accept people, every person is like 
      a **key on the piano** - each key sounds right if it's in the right place and in the right song. Meaning every person
      can be good and useful if he is in the right environment.
4. **Meaning**. Living without meaning is akin to a car connected to 7 horses all pulling in different directions.
    Meaning is what gives you direction in life and what allows you to move forward and progress.
    - "Satisfy the necessities of life – hunger with food, thirst with drink – like the **butterfly that sips the 
      flower**, without destroying its fragrance or its texture".
    - Mother Teresa released a book which shocked everyone, in which she confessed that she stuggled finding meaning 
      in life.
6. **Forgiveness**. People who can forgive have less stress, live longer. Anger can hurt you more than it hurts 
    the target of your anger.
    - President Ronald Reagan was shot by an assassin. He felt anger to him but decided to forgive to relieve himself.
      Forgiveness started healing him before surgeon know did.
    - Realising that actions of other might b caused by their innocent ignorance will make forgiving easier.
7. Don't judge other people.  
    - Weak or kind
    - Inconsiderate or upfront
    - Stingy or generous
    - Lazy or careful
    - Obstinate or confident
    - Wasteful or tasteful
8. The 4 horseman of the apocalypse: Contempt (презрение), Defensiveness, Criticism, Stonewalling.
9. **P/N ration** - positive to negative feedback ration. There's a research that shows that happy families have P/N
    ration higher than 5.
10. Volcanoes server a purpose - they prevent earthquakes, release pressure from beneath earth. Healthy argument serves a
    similar purpose. You ability to voice disagreement helps to keep democracy alive at home and nationally.
11. To say "no" use a sandwich of "yes", "no", "yes". 
    - "I'd like to meet you, but have too much going on right now. How about next monday".
12. Apologise when appropriate - your apology should be simple. It's not a sign of weakness or timidity, 
    it's on the contrary a sign of strength.
13. Negativity bias - the mind is biased toward negativity. This is important for survival because missing adversity
    can kill you while missing fortune can't.  
14. **[Top five regrets of the dying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Top_Five_Regrets_of_the_Dying)**
  - "I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me."
  - "I wish I hadn't worked so hard."
  - "I wish I'd had the courage to express my feelings."
  - "I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends."
  - "I wish that I had let myself be happier."
  
## The Lean Startup

https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898

**Key idea**: ship an MVP quickly to users to get their feedback, iterate fast. 
This will help you to avoid wasting time on building products that no one needs.

**Pros**:
- Some ideas from Lean Manufacturing are interesting, e.g. the [Five whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys)
- Some startups mentioned in the book are interesting

**Cons**:
- Mostly opinions and experiences of the author
- Many of the use case examples of companies in the book failed to grow
- The startup the author founded - IMVU - failed to grow
- The author is a consultant

**Points**:

- **Learning**
    - The company that the author build: https://IMVU.com
    - Launch an early low quality prototype, and MVP, to get feedback from customers to avoid building something 
      no one needs.
    - Charge customers from day 1 
    - Use low volume revenue targets as a way to drive accountability

- **Experiment**
    - Entrepreneurs should experiment more, do strategic planning less. This allows them to learn about problems 
      users have and how to solve them.

- **Leap**
    - There are two leaps of faith: value and growth.
    - Companies should minimize feedback loop, build MVP and release it, get feedback from users. 
    - Toyota has a chief engineer who oversees the entire production. New model Siena was designed for children.

- **Test**
    - Develop an MVP to test your ideas. 
    - [Food on the Table](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/food-on-the-table) had their CEO go to customers 
      as concierge to create groceries list etc.
    - [Aardvark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aardvark_(search_engine)) - social search engine for subjective questions. 
       Hired people to replicate backend. **Wizard of Oz Testing** - users think they interact with a machine while 
       in fact there is a human behind the scenes doing the work.

- **Measure**
    - Don't use vanity metrics - gross number of customers, revenue. It doesn't tell you if actions of 
      the entrepreneurial team have any positive effect.
    - [Grockit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grockit), an online social learning game company, used split testing 
      to find out if their initiatives work. Ceased to exist in 2016.
    - Teams are evaluated by using validated learning, i.e. validating that new features improved core metrics, 
      not by simply production of new features.
    - Three As of good metrics: **actionable, accessible, auditable**.

- **Pivot or Persevere**
    - Kching- platform for amateur traders, designed as a game
    - [Five whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys), by Sakichi Toyoda. Below is an example:
        - A new release broke a feature for customers; why, because a particular server failed; why, because of 
        an obscure subsystem used in a wrong way; why, the engineer who used it didn't know how to use it properly;
        why, because he was never trained; why, his manager doesn't believe in training new engineers because he 
        and his team are too busy. the Five whys helped identify a managerial problem which seemed like a technical problem.


## Mastering Fear

"The brave man is not the one who has no fear, he's the one who triumphs over his fear" - Nelson Mandela.

[Systematic desensitization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_desensitization) - The process of systematic 
desensitization occurs in three steps. The first step of systematic desensitization is the identification of an 
anxiety inducing stimulus hierarchy. The second step is the learning of relaxation or coping techniques. 
When the individual has been taught these skills, he or she must use them in the third step to react towards 
and overcome situations in the established hierarchy of fears. The goal of this process is for the individual 
to learn how to cope with, and overcome the fear in each step of the hierarchy. 

[SEAL BUD/S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy_SEAL_selection_and_training#Basic_Underwater_Demolition/SEAL_(BUD/S)_Training_(24_weeks)) - Basic Underwater Demolition - is a 24-week training course that develops the SEAL candidates' mental 
and physical stamina and leadership skills. Each BUD/S phase includes timed physical condition tests, with the time 
requirements becoming more demanding each week.

Sleep is a weapon.

You experience anxiety or stress when you know you need to do something but you don't do it due to procrastination. 
To get rid of anxiety or stress just starting making steps towards fixing what causes it. Jeff Bezos. 

**Lessons** (from [here](https://alexandbooks.com/archive/mastering-fear-by-brandon-webb-john-mann)):

1. **Prepare More Than You Need**
    - In the course of one season an oak tree will drop thousands of acorns. Why? All it takes to safely reproduce itself and continue to oak species is a single acorn. So what are all those others? Rough drafts.
    - When directors film a movie, they spend many hours and sometimes days filming a 1-minute scene over and over again. The same scene can be shot over twenty times, but eventually, only one clip is chosen. 
    - Pilots run dozens or even hundreds of what-if scenarios: What to do if an engine goes out; if there's an electrical problem; if communications go down and more. 

2. **True Safety is an Illusion**
    - Fear is awareness of danger, right? And naturally, you want to keep yourself safe, correct? Ah, but that's a trap! And within that trap is a secret, one that might be uncomfortable to hear but will liberate you if you let it: You're never safe.
    - Every great gain, for humanity as a whole or for you or me in our own lives, has come about only through risk.
    
3. **Trust Your Gut and Jump**
    - A lot of times in life people find themselves in a situation where they know what they have to do and it feels 
    like the universe is telling them to do it, but the people around them may try to stop them. This is why it's 
    important to trust your gut and jump when things feel right.
    - Brandon tells the story of a young mechanic named Douglas Corrigan who was inspired to fly after Charles Lindbergh 
    flew his plane across the Atlantic. Lindbergh became an American hero and became Time magazine's first 
    "person of the year."

## Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind

https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316095

- Homo Sapiens (man wise) - Homo is genus, sapiens is species.
- Mix of a horse and a donkey is a mule. Mules are infertile. 
    Animals within the same species can mate and produce fertile offspring.
- Homo Sapiens originated in East Africa around **100k** years ago. 
    Like other humans, Neanderthals originated in Africa but migrated to Eurasia long before other humans did.
- **Cognitive revolution** is when language was invented, around 50k years ago. 
    - Gossiping is the primary utility of language and why it developed. 
        150 is the number of members of a group when gossiping is efficient without hierarchy.
- **Agricultural revolution** happened 12k years ago. Before that humans were hunter-gatherers. 
    - Our brain is shaped to hunter-gatherer style of living happening for 88k out of 100k years.
    - Hunter-gatherers have to move from place to place frequently so they didn't have many possessions. A modern 
        human has many posessions due to consumerism. 
    - Wheat, rice, potato domesticated humans. 
        I.e. they accomplished evolutionary goal of spreading their genes across globe.
- People eradicated large animals from earth like Mammoths, because they had a lot of meat. 
    Also the climate change helped.
- [Unification of humankind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapiens:_A_Brief_History_of_Humankind#Summary) 
    - There are different levels of existence: objective, subjective (created and belived by the mind of a single individual), 
        inter subjective (created and believed by the society). 
    - From the **American Constitution**: all men are created equal, they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable 
        rights among these are life, liberty and the persuit of happiness. 
        This translates in biological terms to: all men evolved differently, born with certain immutable characteristics 
        and among these are life and the pursuit of pleasure.
    - **Raping a woman** was considered a property violation, rapist had to pay to the father of the woman. 
        Giving birth to a girl was considered a misfortune in China. Parents often killed girls to get another chance.
    - **Equality and liberty** are in contradiction with each other. 
        Soviet Union: everyone is equal but there is no freedom.

- **Money** is the invention that catalysed trade. 
    - First silver ingots appeared 3000 years BC. 
    - Money replaces other beliefs such as belief in honor, honesty, generocity.

- First missionary **religions** appeared in the 1st century BC (Before Christ)/
    - Catholics believed that to atone for their sins people have to do good deeds. 
    - Protestants believed that Christ already atoned for all sins, if we believe we need to do more we devalue Christ's sacrifice.
    - Christianity is a monotheistic religion but saints mirror poly gods
    - Nirvana literally means extinguishing the fire
    - There are 2 types of chaos:
        - Level 1 chaos - e.g. weather
        - Level 2 chaos - e.g. markets, they react to predictions

- **Memetics** - similar to how organic units spread using genes, cultural ideas spread using memes.
    - This term was coined by Richard Dawkins. 
    - Postmodernists see discourses as units of culture. In this sense Postmodernism is a younger sister of memetics.

- 1500 year - the **Scientific Revolution**

## The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership

https://www.amazon.com/21-Irrefutable-Laws-Leadership-Anniversary/dp/149151311X

- Pros: interesting stories, good quotes.
- Cons: no scientific data, purely opinions of the author.

1. **THE LAW OF THE LID** - Leadership Ability Determines a Person's Level of Effectiveness.

2. **THE LAW OF INFLUENCE** - The true measure of leadership is influence – nothing more, nothing less.

3. **THE LAW OF PROCESS** - Leadership develops daily, not in a day.
    - Champions don't become champions in a ring, they are simply recognized there.
    - It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

4. **THE LAW OF NAVIGATION** - Anyone can steer the ship, but it takes a leader to chart the course.
    - A leader is one who sees more than other see, who sees farther than other see, and who sees before others do.

5. **THE LAW OF ADDITION** - Leaders add value by serving others.

6. **THE LAW OF SOLID GROUND** - Trust is the Foundation of Leadership.

7. **THE LAW OF RESPECT** - People naturally follow leaders stronger than themselves.

11. **THE LAW OF CONNECTION** - Leaders touch a heart before they ask for a hand.

12. **THE LAW OF THE INNER CIRCLE** - A leader's potential is determined by those closest to him.

13. **THE LAW OF THE PICTURE** - People do what people see.

14. **THE LAW OF BUY-IN** - People buy into the leader, then the vision.

15. **THE LAW OF THE BIG MO** - Momentum is a leader's best friend.

16. **THE LAW OF VICTORY** - Leaders find a way for the team to win.

17. **THE LAW OF PRIORITIES** - Leaders understand that activity is not necessarily accomplishment.

18. **THE LAW OF SACRIFICE** - A leader must give up to go up.

19. **THE LAW OF TIMING** - When to lead is as important as What to do and Where to go.
