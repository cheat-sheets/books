## How Google Works

https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23158207-how-google-works

Google Search doesn't have any network effect. Google's culture does. Google is hiring the best of the best engineers
which attracts more best engineers. Every new engineer increases the value of the company non-linearly and increases
the chance more best engineers will want to join.

- If you want something done, give it to a busy person
- Knights and knaves and divas
- Base your product on strong technical insight, not on market research
    - Google Search - PageRank
    - AdWords - rank ads by how often people click on ads
    - Google News - group news by topic not source
- Focus on growth not revenue
- A fox knows everything but hedgehog knows one big thing. Good to great - all great companies are hedgehogs. Specializing is a riskier strategy.
- Hire good people, good people attract good people. Bad people attract bad people. Smart creatives are someone who is smart and creative.
- Pick the industry (early in the career) then the company (later in the career). 
- Negotiation rules: PIA (have patience, information, alternatives)
- Opra Winfree rule - it's not enough to make a good argument supported by data, you need to touch people's hearts.
- Spend 80% of your time on 80% of your revenue.
- Climb, Confess, Comply mode (when pilots are in danger they first fly higher, then talk to dispatcher, then follow his recommendation)
- 2 level game theory
- Jobs reality distortion field - Jobs asked engineer if he could shave off 10 seconds from the macintosh bootup time. 
    He said no. Then asked again but what if a person's life depended on it? He said well maybe. In a month he shaved of 20 seconds.
- Google X Venn Diagram to decide whether to pursue an idea:
	- Solves a big challenge
	- Solution that's radically different from anything else on the market
	- Feasible, achievable in not distance future
- 70/20/10 rule.
- Red flag law in the UK - after a car accident the government came up with a regulation that instructed to have 
    a person with a red flag coming in front of every car, and 2 mile/h in the city, 4 miles/h outside.

## The Power of Habit

https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X

- Tingling in the mouth after brushing teeth is created by marketers to give people an illusion that the tooth paste
    works. The chemicals in the tooth paste that cause tingling don't have any purpose other than to create this illusion.
- [Febreze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Febreze) eliminates odor. People didn't want to buy it at first.
    Proctor & Gamble marketers added a scent and created an association with freshness via advertisement which increased
    sales by multiple times.

## Zero to One

https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296

1. There is vertical and horizontal progress. 
    - **Vertical** progress is a radical improvement, going from zero to one, and is achievable using technology.
    - **Horizontal** progress is expanding on the radical improvement, e.g. via globalisation. 
    - USA makes vertical progress, China horizontal.
2. The dot com boom and burst people created **dogmas**:
    - Make incremental advances, small steps,
    - Be lean, don't plan far ahead,
    - Improve on the competition, don't try to create new market prematurely,
    - Focus on product, not advertising
  Depending on the circumstances, the company and the market conditions the opposite might be true.
3. Monopolies try to conceal they are monopolies, to avoid anti-trust laws. E.g. Google claims it has 3% in global
    advertising business. They support the claim by using union of factors, e.g. Google unions digital advertisement
    markets and non-digital. 
  Non-monopolies try to convince investors they own entire market, e.g. a British food restaurant in Bay Area telling
   they own entire market. They support the claim by using intersection of factors e.g. a British food restaurant, 
   in a specific area, themed with rock-n-roll style.
4. All successful companies are unique, they become monopolies for solving unique problems. All failed companies 
    are same, they fail to escape the competition.
5. Competition is not always good for companies, and consumers. A monopoly has spare resources to invest in
    long-term visionary projects. Companies in the environment of strong competition have little spare resources. 
    PayPal had to merge with x.com to survive the financial crisis.
6. Moats:
  - Proprietary technology
  - Network effects
  - Economies of scale
  - Brand
7. Biotech companies struggle to succeed comparing to tech companies, because the human body is a lot more complex that
    computer systems built by humans.
8. Power Law:
    - Only a few companies in investment portfolio justify all other failed investments. Invest only in companies that
    have a potential to justify all other investments. 
    - Only a few decisions are most important
    - Distribution channels follow the Power Law.
9. Secrets - ask yourself a question, what thing do you know that other struggle to understand. This secret gives you
    an edge in achieving success. 
    - Kazinskiy: goals can be easy to achieve, hard to achieve and impossible to achieve. All problems that are hard
    to achieve have already been solved, easy goals don't bring satisfaction - the only way to happiness is to destroy
    the civilization and start over.
10. Foundations are important for startups. 
    - CEO should pay little to himself and be mostly incentivized by his stake in the company.
    - Founders should have worked before and know each other well.
11. PayPal mafia:
    - Spend time with people you like - you spend most time with colleagues.
    - Company should be a cult. Opposite are consulting firms like Accenture where employees has no connections to it.
12. Sales matter.
13. Machines will complement people not replace them. 
14. Green Tech:
    - Engineering - your solution must be orders of magnitude better. 
    - Timing - is it the right time now?
    - Monopoly - you better have a big share in a small market.
    - Team - you must have the right team.
    - Distribution - you must have distribution channels.
    - Durability - you should have a defendable position for 10-20 years into the future.
    - Secret - you must have a secret no one knows. 

## Stress-Free Living

https://www.amazon.com/Mayo-Clinic-Guide-Stress-Free-Living/dp/B01J2BMZD2

1. Mind has 2 states: **focused** and **default**. Focused mode is when the mind is externally directed, 
    default mode is when the mind is internally directed. 
    - [A Wandering Mind is an Unhappy Mind](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/330/6006/932.full)
    - Ruminations are thoughts about past events, worries are thoughts about future events.
    - Mind can only keep around 7 items of information at a time. It has a queue of tasks or things to think about. 
      When the queue is too long it causes "thrashing" or stress.
2. Human mind selectively attends to threat, pleasure and novelty. 
    - Threat is the predominant focus. 
    - The majority of modern threats are our inter-emotional battles.
    - Our minds are innately restless and irrational.
    - The new mantra of survival is "survival of the kindest". Some research shows that people look for kindness in
      their partners.
3. Be happy with what you have, don't compare yourself with others, compare yourself with previous version of you.
    What you have now many people can't even dream about. 
    - A story of how **Darwin** lost his beetles while he was collecting samples of insects. He had 2 beetles - one in 
      each hand. He saw another beetle not far from him and wanted to pick him. After putting one of the beetles in
      his mouth, the beetle stung his tongue, Darwin shoked had to throw away both beetles and lost the 3rd too. 
      The moral is be content with what you have.
    - **Acceptance** - don't cling to desired outcomes, accept everything. Accept people, every person is like 
      a **key on the piano** - each key sounds right if it's in the right place and in the right song. Meaning every person
      can be good and useful if he is in the right environment.
4. **Meaning**. Living without meaning is akin to a car connected to 7 horses all pulling in different directions.
    Meaning is what gives you direction in life and what allows you to move forward and progress.
    - "Satisfy the necessities of life – hunger with food, thirst with drink – like the **butterfly that sips the 
      flower**, without destroying its fragrance or its texture".
    - Mother Teresa released a book which shocked everyone, in which she confessed that she stuggled finding meaning 
      in life.
6. **Forgiveness**. People who can forgive have less stress, live longer. Anger can hurt you more than it hurts 
    the target of your anger.
    - President Ronald Reagan was shot by an assassin. He felt anger to him but decided to forgive to relieve himself.
      Forgiveness started healing him before surgeon know did.
    - Realising that actions of other might b caused by their innocent ignorance will make forgiving easier.
7. Don't judge other people.  
    - Weak or kind
    - Inconsiderate or upfront
    - Stingy or generous
    - Lazy or careful
    - Obstinate or confident
    - Wasteful or tasteful
8. The 4 horseman of the apocalypse: Contempt (презрение), Defensiveness, Criticism, Stonewalling.
9. **P/N ration** - positive to negative feedback ration. There's a research that shows that happy families have P/N
    ration higher than 5.
10. Volcanoes server a purpose - they prevent earthquakes, release pressure from beneath earth. Healthy argument serves a
    similar purpose. You ability to voice disagreement helps to keep democracy alive at home and nationally.
11. To say "no" use a sandwich of "yes", "no", "yes". 
    - "I'd like to meet you, but have too much going on right now. How about next monday".
12. Apologise when appropriate - your apology should be simple. It's not a sign of weakness or timidity, 
    it's on the contrary a sign of strength.
13. Negativity bias - the mind is biased toward negativity. This is important for survival because missing adversity
    can kill you while missing fortune can't.  
14. **[Top five regrets of the dying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Top_Five_Regrets_of_the_Dying)**
  - "I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me."
  - "I wish I hadn't worked so hard."
  - "I wish I'd had the courage to express my feelings."
  - "I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends."
  - "I wish that I had let myself be happier."
  
## The Lean Startup

https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898

**Key idea**: ship an MVP quickly to users to get their feedback, iterate fast. 
This will help you to avoid wasting time on building products that no one needs.

**Pros**:
- Some ideas from Lean Manufacturing are interesting, e.g. the [Five whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys)
- Some startups mentioned in the book are interesting

**Cons**:
- Mostly opinions and experiences of the author
- Many of the use case examples of companies in the book failed to grow
- The startup the author founded - IMVU - failed to grow
- The author is a consultant

**Points**:

- **Learning**
    - The company that the author build: https://IMVU.com
    - Launch an early low quality prototype, and MVP, to get feedback from customers to avoid building something 
      no one needs.
    - Charge customers from day 1 
    - Use low volume revenue targets as a way to drive accountability

- **Experiment**
    - Entrepreneurs should experiment more, do strategic planning less. This allows them to learn about problems 
      users have and how to solve them.

- **Leap**
    - There are two leaps of faith: value and growth.
    - Companies should minimize feedback loop, build MVP and release it, get feedback from users. 
    - Toyota has a chief engineer who oversees the entire production. New model Siena was designed for children.

- **Test**
    - Develop an MVP to test your ideas. 
    - [Food on the Table](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/food-on-the-table) had their CEO go to customers 
      as concierge to create groceries list etc.
    - [Aardvark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aardvark_(search_engine)) - social search engine for subjective questions. 
       Hired people to replicate backend. **Wizard of Oz Testing** - users think they interact with a machine while 
       in fact there is a human behind the scenes doing the work.

- **Measure**
    - Don't use vanity metrics - gross number of customers, revenue. It doesn’t tell you if actions of 
      the entrepreneurial team have any positive effect.
    - [Grockit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grockit), an online social learning game company, used split testing 
      to find out if their initiatives work. Ceased to exist in 2016.
    - Teams are evaluated by using validated learning, i.e. validating that new features improved core metrics, 
      not by simply production of new features.
    - Three As of good metrics: **actionable, accessible, auditable**.

- **Pivot or Persevere**
    - Kching- platform for amateur traders, designed as a game
    - [Five whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys), by Sakichi Toyoda. Below is an example:
        - A new release broke a feature for customers; why, because a particular server failed; why, because of 
        an obscure subsystem used in a wrong way; why, the engineer who used it didn't know how to use it properly;
        why, because he was never trained; why, his manager doesn't believe in training new engineers because he 
        and his team are too busy. the Five whys helped identify a managerial problem which seemed like a technical problem.


## Mastering Fear

"The brave man is not the one who has no fear, he's the one who triumphs over his fear" - Nelson Mandela.

[Systematic desensitization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_desensitization) - The process of systematic 
desensitization occurs in three steps. The first step of systematic desensitization is the identification of an 
anxiety inducing stimulus hierarchy. The second step is the learning of relaxation or coping techniques. 
When the individual has been taught these skills, he or she must use them in the third step to react towards 
and overcome situations in the established hierarchy of fears. The goal of this process is for the individual 
to learn how to cope with, and overcome the fear in each step of the hierarchy. 

[SEAL BUD/S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy_SEAL_selection_and_training#Basic_Underwater_Demolition/SEAL_(BUD/S)_Training_(24_weeks)) - Basic Underwater Demolition - is a 24-week training course that develops the SEAL candidates' mental 
and physical stamina and leadership skills. Each BUD/S phase includes timed physical condition tests, with the time 
requirements becoming more demanding each week.

Sleep is a weapon.

You experience anxiety or stress when you know you need to do something but you don't do it due to procrastination. 
To get rid of anxiety or stress just starting making steps towards fixing what causes it. Jeff Bezos. 

**Lessons** (from [here](https://alexandbooks.com/archive/mastering-fear-by-brandon-webb-john-mann)):

1. **Prepare More Than You Need**
    - In the course of one season an oak tree will drop thousands of acorns. Why? All it takes to safely reproduce itself and continue to oak species is a single acorn. So what are all those others? Rough drafts.
    - When directors film a movie, they spend many hours and sometimes days filming a 1-minute scene over and over again. The same scene can be shot over twenty times, but eventually, only one clip is chosen. 
    - Pilots run dozens or even hundreds of what-if scenarios: What to do if an engine goes out; if there’s an electrical problem; if communications go down and more. 

2. **True Safety is an Illusion**
    - Fear is awareness of danger, right? And naturally, you want to keep yourself safe, correct? Ah, but that’s a trap! And within that trap is a secret, one that might be uncomfortable to hear but will liberate you if you let it: You’re never safe.
    - Every great gain, for humanity as a whole or for you or me in our own lives, has come about only through risk.
    
3. **Trust Your Gut and Jump**
    - A lot of times in life people find themselves in a situation where they know what they have to do and it feels 
    like the universe is telling them to do it, but the people around them may try to stop them. This is why it's 
    important to trust your gut and jump when things feel right.
    - Brandon tells the story of a young mechanic named Douglas Corrigan who was inspired to fly after Charles Lindbergh 
    flew his plane across the Atlantic. Lindbergh became an American hero and became Time magazine's first 
    "person of the year."

    - From the **American Constitution**: all men are created equal, they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable 
        rights among these are life, liberty and the persuit of happiness.

- **Memetics** - similar to how organic units spread using genes, cultural ideas spread using memes.
    - This term was coined by Richard Dawkins. 
    - Postmodernists see discourses as units of culture. In this sense Postmodernism is a younger sister of memetics.

- 1500 year - the **Scientific Revolution**
    - Based on collecting data and creating theories from these data.
    - **Scottish Widows - the first insurance company**, used statistics to predict gatherings of money that would be
        enough to compensate for losses of husbands. 
    - Science solved poverty, famine, disease, but not yet death.
    - 1768 - expedition led by James Cook. 
        - His crew wes sent to Tahiti to observe transition of Venus to 
            calculate the distance of the Earth from the Sun. The data collected in the expedition sparkled research 
        in many fields. 
        - In that expedition it was found that Scurvy is caused by lack of vitamin C.
        - Tasmanian and Australian aboriginals were exterminated by expeditions that were half scientific half imperial.
