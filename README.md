https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23158207-how-google-works

- If you want something done, give it to a busy person
- Knights and knaves and divas
- Base your product on strong technical insight, not on market research
	- Google Search - PageRank
	- AdWords - rank ads by how often people click on ads
	- Google News - group news by topic not source
- Focus on growth not revenue
- A fox knows everything but hedgehog knows one big thing. Good to great - all great companies are hedgehogs. Specializing is a riskier strategy.
- Hire good people, good people attract good people. Bad people attract bad people. Smart creatives are someone who is smart and creative.
- Pick the industry (early in the career) then the company (later in the career). 
- Negotiation rules: PIA (have patience, information, alternatives)
- Opra Winfree rule - it's not enough to make a good argument supported by data, you need to touch people's hearts.
- Spend 80% of your time on 80% of your revenue.
- Climb, Confess, Comply mode (when pilots are in danger they first fly higher, then talk to dispatcher, then follow his recommendation)
- 2 level game theory
- Jobs reality distortion field - Jobs asked engineer if he could shave off 10 seconds from the macintosh bootup time. 
    He said no. Then asked again but what if a person's life depended on it? He said well maybe. In a month he shaved of 20 seconds.
- Google X Venn Diagram to decide whether to pursue an idea:
	- Solves a big challenge
	- Solution that's radically different from anything else on the market
	- Feasible, achievable in not distance future
- 70/20/10 rule.
- Red flag law in the UK - after a car accident the government came up with a regulation that instructed to have 
    a person with a red flag coming in front of every car, and 2 mile/h in the city, 4 miles/h outside.

## The Power of Habit

https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X

- Tingling in the mouth after brushing teeth is created by marketers to give people an illusion that the tooth paste
    works. The chemicals in the tooth paste that cause tingling don't have any purpose other than to create this illusion.
- [Febreze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Febreze) eliminates odor. People didn't want to buy it at first.
    Proctor & Gamble marketers added a scent and created an association with freshness via advertisement which increased
    sales by multiple times.

## Zero to One

https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296

1. There is vertical and horizontal progress. 
    - **Vertical** progress is a radical improvement, going from zero to one, and is achievable using technology.
    - **Horizontal** progress is expanding on the radical improvement, e.g. via globalisation. 
    - USA makes vertical progress, China horizontal.
2. The dot com boom and burst people created **dogmas**:
    - Make incremental advances, small steps,
    - Be lean, don't plan far ahead,
    - Improve on the competition, don't try to create new market prematurely,
    - Focus on product, not advertising
  Depending on the circumstances, the company and the market conditions the opposite might be true.
3. Monopolies try to conceal they are monopolies, to avoid anti-trust laws. E.g. Google claims it has 3% in global
    advertising business. They support the claim by using union of factors, e.g. Google unions digital advertisement
    markets and non-digital. 
  Non-monopolies try to convince investors they own entire market, e.g. a British food restaurant in Bay Area telling
   they own entire market. They support the claim by using intersection of factors e.g. a British food restaurant, 
   in a specific area, themed with rock-n-roll style.
4. All successful companies are unique, they become monopolies for solving unique problems. All failed companies 
    are same, they fail to escape the competition.
5. Competition is not always good for companies, and consumers. A monopoly has spare resources to invest in
    long-term visionary projects. Companies in the environment of strong competition have little spare resources. 
    PayPal had to merge with x.com to survive the financial crisis.
6. Moats:
  - Proprietary technology
  - Network effects
  - Economies of scale
  - Brand
7. Biotech companies struggle to succeed comparing to tech companies, because the human body is a lot more complex that
    computer systems built by humans.
8. Power Law:
    - Only a few companies in investment portfolio justify all other failed investments. Invest only in companies that
    have a potential to justify all other investments. 
    - Only a few decisions are most important
    - Distribution channels follow the Power Law.
9. Secrets - ask yourself a question, what thing do you know that other struggle to understand. This secret gives you
    an edge in achieving success. 
    - Kazinskiy: goals can be easy to achieve, hard to achieve and impossible to achieve. All problems that are hard
    to achieve have already been solved, easy goals don't bring satisfaction - the only way to happiness is to destroy
    the civilization and start over.
10. Foundations are important for startups. 
    - CEO should pay little to himself and be mostly incentivized by his stake in the company.
    - Founders should have worked before and know each other well.
11. PayPal mafia:
    - Spend time with people you like - you spend most time with colleagues.
    - Company should be a cult. Opposite are consulting firms like Accenture where employees has no connections to it.
12. Sales matter.
13. Machines will complement people not replace them. 
14. Green Tech:
    - Engineering - your solution must be orders of magnitude better. 
    - Timing - is it the right time now?
    - Monopoly - you better have a big share in a small market.
    - Team - you must have the right team.
    - Distribution - you must have distribution channels.
    - Durability - you should have a defendable position for 10-20 years into the future.
    - Secret - you must have a secret no one knows. 

## Stress-Free Living

https://www.amazon.com/Mayo-Clinic-Guide-Stress-Free-Living/dp/B01J2BMZD2

1. Mind has 2 states: **focused** and **default**. Focused mode is when the mind is externally directed, 
    default mode is when the mind is internally directed. 
    - [A Wandering Mind is an Unhappy Mind](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/330/6006/932.full)
    - Ruminations are thoughts about past events, worries are thoughts about future events.
    - Mind can only keep around 7 items of information at a time. It has a queue of tasks or things to think about. 
      When the queue is too long it causes "thrashing" or stress.
2. Human mind selectively attends to threat, pleasure and novelty. 
    - Threat is the predominant focus. 
    - The majority of modern threats are our inter-emotional battles.
    - Our minds are innately restless and irrational.
    - The new mantra of survival is "survival of the kindest". Some research shows that people look for kindness in
      their partners.
3. Be happy with what you have, don't compare yourself with others, compare yourself with previous version of you.
    What you have now many people can't even dream about. 
    - A story of how **Darwin** lost his beetles while he was collecting samples of insects. He had 2 beetles - one in 
      each hand. He saw another beetle not far from him and wanted to pick him. After putting one of the beetles in
      his mouth, the beetle stung his tongue, Darwin shoked had to throw away both beetles and lost the 3rd too. 
      The moral is be content with what you have.
    - **Acceptance** - don't cling to desired outcomes, accept everything. Accept people, every person is like 
      a **key on the piano** - each key sounds right if it's in the right place and in the right song. Meaning every person
      can be good and useful if he is in the right environment.
4. **Meaning**. Living without meaning is akin to a car connected to 7 horses all pulling in different directions.
    Meaning is what gives you direction in life and what allows you to move forward and progress.
    - "Satisfy the necessities of life – hunger with food, thirst with drink – like the **butterfly that sips the 
      flower**, without destroying its fragrance or its texture".
    - Mother Teresa released a book which shocked everyone, in which she confessed that she stuggled finding meaning 
      in life.
6. **Forgiveness**. People who can forgive have less stress, live longer. Anger can hurt you more than it hurts 
    the target of your anger.
    - President Ronald Reagan was shot by an assassin. He felt anger to him but decided to forgive to relieve himself.
      Forgiveness started healing him before surgeon know did.
    - Realising that actions of other might b caused by their innocent ignorance will make forgiving easier.
7. Don't judge other people.  
    - Weak or kind
    - Inconsiderate or upfront
    - Stingy or generous
    - Lazy or careful
    - Obstinate or confident
    - Wasteful or tasteful
8. The 4 horseman of the apocalypse: Contempt (презрение), Defensiveness, Criticism, Stonewalling.
9. **P/N ration** - positive to negative feedback ration. There's a research that shows that happy families have P/N
    ration higher than 5.
10. Volcanoes server a purpose - they prevent earthquakes, release pressure from beneath earth. Healthy argument serves a
    similar purpose. You ability to voice disagreement helps to keep democracy alive at home and nationally.
11. To say "no" use a sandwich of "yes", "no", "yes". 
    - "I'd like to meet you, but have too much going on right now. How about next monday".
12. Apologise when appropriate - your apology should be simple. It's not a sign of weakness or timidity, 
    it's on the contrary a sign of strength.
13. Negativity bias - the mind is biased toward negativity. This is important for survival because missing adversity
    can kill you while missing fortune can't.  
14. **[Top five regrets of the dying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Top_Five_Regrets_of_the_Dying)**
  - "I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me."
  - "I wish I hadn't worked so hard."
  - "I wish I'd had the courage to express my feelings."
  - "I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends."
  - "I wish that I had let myself be happier."
